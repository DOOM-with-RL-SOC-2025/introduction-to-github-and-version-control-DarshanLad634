# Hi I am Darshan 
## This is my first time making a markdown file

*So far I understand most of the stuff*

**But it is taking time getting used to it**

***Some of the text formatting is similar to that of discord***

**I cant find the _toolbar_ though which is mentioned in the tutorial**

Just checking if it works
```
git init
git status
git add hi.py
```
